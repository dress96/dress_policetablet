This new project, I am creating a new police tablet based to a ios system in a ipad. Currently, only parts have finished the code but other parts, is in process. The following is ready:

- Based html/css page and adactable a many screen resolutions in GTA.

- Currently, it's scripting in ESX frameword but, in the future, I want to change the script to Qbus framework and my own framework DCore.

- Many funcionalities, its already made but, others, are in the middle or waiting to do them

**Remember that this is an alpha, not even a beta, of what will be the final script that will be updated.**
